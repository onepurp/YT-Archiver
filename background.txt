### **Linux (systemd)** - The Gold Standard

Your `systemd` approach is the modern, correct way to manage services on most Linux distributions.

*   **Correctness:** The commands (`cp`, `daemon-reload`, `enable`, `start`, `status`) are exactly right.
*   **Best Practice:** This is far superior to older methods like `init.d` scripts or running things in `tmux` or `screen` for a true service, because `systemd` handles logging, restarts, and dependencies automatically.
*   **Enhancement:** Inside your `yt-archiver.service` file, you should absolutely include a `[Service]` directive like `Restart=always` or `Restart=on-failure`. This tells `systemd` to automatically restart your script if it ever crashes, which is the key to making it truly "run forever."

**Example `yt-archiver.service` block:**
```ini
[Service]
User=your_username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/script/folder
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script/main.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
```

### **Windows (Task Scheduler)** - The Native Solution

Using Task Scheduler is the canonical way to do this on Windows.

*   **Correctness:** Your plan is solid.
*   **Best Practice:** You correctly identified the key settings: trigger, action, and conditions. Using `pythonw.exe` instead of `python.exe` is a pro move to prevent a console window from popping up. Setting the "Start in" (Working Directory) field is also critical and often forgotten.
*   **Clarification on Trigger:**
    *   If `main.py` is a script that runs continuously in a loop (e.g., `while True:`), your trigger should simply be **"At startup"**.
    *   If `main.py` is a script that runs, does a task, and then exits, your trigger **"At startup"** combined with **"Repeat task every X minutes"** is perfect.

### **macOS (launchd)** - The Apple Way

Your `launchd` plan is the correct, modern approach for macOS.

*   **Correctness:** The file, paths, and commands (`cp`, `launchctl load`, `launchctl start`) are all correct.
*   **Best Practice:** This is the Apple-sanctioned replacement for `cron` and other methods. It's powerful and integrates directly with the OS.
*   **Key Distinction (for your reference):**
    *   `~/Library/LaunchAgents`: You chose this correctly. It runs the task as your user, **when you log in**.
    *   `/Library/LaunchDaemons`: If you ever needed a script to run at system boot (even if no user logs in), you would place the `.plist` file here and have it run as `root` or another system user.
